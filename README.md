Building a website for the The Stork Club In Oakland, Calif.
This is a project for Code Platoon, a coding bootcamp in Chicago
for Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces

I have decided to take this website http://storkcluboakland.com/
and make it a Rails App. All functions will be automated, requiring
only limited interaction from the owner, via either a log-in or an email
button press, to handle all the described functionality.

Required Parts
--------------
- [] Transfer over the current site and functionality with a few HTML/CSS tweaks
- [] I will then add a form for bands to request a booking on a particular calendar day.
- [] I will then add a calendar that is updated via the DB when a bands booking is confirmed.
- [] I will then add a feed to the front page that cycles through that weeks shows every morning.
- [] I will set-up mailers that autmatically send out emails for certain events on the site.

Possible Additions
------------------
- [] I will then have Social Media Updates.
- [] Manager/Booker site Log-in and DB management
- [] Band Log-in for Booking Updates
