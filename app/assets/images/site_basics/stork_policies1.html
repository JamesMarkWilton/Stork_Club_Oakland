<P>Responsibilities of bands/performers:</P>
</U></B>
<P>1. All performers appearing at the STORK CLUB must be at least 21 years old
with <B><I>valid</I></B> <B>ID</B> to be presented at the door.</P>
<P>2. Bands need a minimum of <B>45 minutes </B>of material to perform. If you <B><I>do
not </I></B>have 45 minutes, please call back when you do.</P>
<P>3. All performers are expected to <B><U>load in </U></B>their equipment
between <B><U>8 PM &amp; 9 PM,</U></B> unless cleared in advance with Emmet, the
booking agent.</P>
<P>4. Show starting times are:</P>
<P>Sunday thru Wednesday - 9 PM</P>
<P>Thurs, Fri, Sat - 10 PM</P>
<P>Nights with 4 or more bands - 9:30 PM</P>
<P>(Start times are subject to change as per Emmett or sound technician.)</P>
<P>4. All performers are expected to check in at the door with the door person
and get stamped (after load in).</P>
<P>5. All performers receiving this document are confirmed for an appearance.</P>
<P>6. Band order will be decided <B>by Emmet, </B>the booking agent.</P>
<P>7. If you are unhappy of the order of the set times, please <B>deal with
Emmett </B>by phone. Emmett has the ability to fix it/make it up to you/explain
why it went down the way it did. Do not assume the sound tech or door person can
fix it. Thanks.</P>
<P>8. Please be respectful of the other bands by setting up and breaking down
quickly and efficiently. Talk to the audience after your set and <B><U>OFF STAGE</U></B>.
Thanks</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><U>
<P>Your appearance date is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</U></B>
<P>You will be expected to initial this identical statement the night you appear
at the club.</P>
<P>(This confirmation is considered a commitment. Commitments are expected to be
fullfilled. <B><I>Failure to show at a scheduled appearance may result in an
inability to be booked again. </I></B>In all cases, communication with Emmett
with as much notice as you can muster, is expected <I>and </I>appreciated.)</P>
<P>5. Bands are expected to stay for the duration of the show (to support the
other bands). It is the nice thing to do! If you need to leave before the show
is over, please mention this <B><I>before</I></B> your gig to Emmett. Bands get
paid when all music has stopped for the evening <I>and </I>we have stopped
collecting door revenue. Bands that leave early will have to pick up their share
at The STORK CLUB during bar hours (Tues-Sun after 4 PM) at a later date. Money <B><I>not
collected </I></B>by bands at the night of performance, will be held for <B><U>90
days</U></B> only, after which time they become the property of the STORK CLUB
and will be used to upgrade the club's PA system.</P>
<P>6. Bands/Performers will not intentionally or willingly destroy STORK CLUB
property. Damaged property may be taken out of your band's share of the door
revenue. (This will not apply to accidents or equipment failure not produced by
obnoxious behavior.)</P>
<B><U>
<P>Hospitality:</P>
</U></B>
<P>1. When all members of each band has arrived, you are entitled to <B><U>one
drink ticket per band member.</U></B> Have one band member of your group pick
them up on behalf of the band. These drink tickets are good for 1 domestic beer,
period. Or* placing $1 in conjunction with your drink ticket will buy one well
drink or an import beer, excluding Guiness.</P>
<P>2. Bands are entitled to one guest per band member. You can give the door
person the name(s) of people to be allowed in at no charge. *<B><U>Note to the
wise! <I>Keep in mind every free admission cuts down the amount of money the
bands receive. </I></U></B>Three or four bands using all their guest passes in
one night, drasticly reduces total door revenue. Consider wisely on free
admissions. It's up to you! If you have invited media to your show, please call
Emmett in advance and he will add them to the house guest list. This helps us
keep track of articles/write-ups as well as maintaining the guest list.</P>
<P>3. The STORK CLUB makes no guarantees nor pays any flat fees - period! The
club's payment policy is: an even door split between bands <B><I><U>after</U></I></B>
door and sound person have been paid from door revenue. ($65 on nights with 3
bands and $85 for nights with 4 bands.) In addition, on nights that the door
draws over $150, a 10% cut will be subtracted to pay Emmett. <B><I><U>Again,
bands will be paid at the end of the night.</P>
</U></I></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P>*Note: </B>Upon occasion, we have <B><I>special performers </I></B>wherein
the split may vary.</P>
<P>I have read and understand these policies and entitlements.</P>
